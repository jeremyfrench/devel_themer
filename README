DEVEL_THEMER

This is a branch of the devel themer module, it is an attempt to get the theme_developer module working in drupal7.

It different from the D6 version in trying to use API functionality rather than overriding the default theme function. 

It is in no way intended for widespread use yet. It functionality is very limited and potentially dangerous. Please use with care.
